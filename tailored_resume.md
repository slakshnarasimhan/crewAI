Post IBM joining OpenJDK(www.infoq.com/news/2010/10/ibm-joins-openjdk),
I'm one of the chosen few from within IBM who have been allowed to
contribute to the OpenJDK project.
As an approved contributor in the OpenJDK project with an emphasis in
bringing up uniformity between the IBM and Oracle implementations of JDK.
I'm currently leading a internal project to bring synergy between the
development practices adopted by OpenJDK and the Java Technologies team.
Beyond this, I also contribute code changes to the PowerPC porting project
(openjdk.java.net/projects/ppc-aix-port)

#### IBM


10 years 4 months

#### Software Development Manager

June 2009 - September 2011 (2 years 4 months)

Technical Manager for the Java Class Library Development team.

Apart from managing a team of 15 people, I work on defining the content,
implementation strategy and software development methodologies to be
employed in the development of the JDK8 release.

This include migrating the existing development process from subversion
to Mercurial, improving the over all build/test efficiency of the Class Library
Component and laying the foundation for the future direction of the IBM JDK.

I also serve on the Requirements Review Board for Java that is responsible for
evaluating customer requirements.

#### Class Library Technical Lead - IBM JDK

January 2008 - March 2010 (2 years 3 months)

As the technical lead of the team, I'm responsible for architecting, designing
and validating the critical line-items that get into the IBM SDK. I help out with
the design, code reviews and the eventual committing of the code.
As JDK forms the under-pinning of the entire IBM middleware, and Class
Libraries form the bulk of it, I'm responsible for the technical evaluation of
all the line items that get into the product. I also serve on the Requirements
Review Board that screens customer requirements and evaluates them for
their suitability and relevance.

#### Midas Internet Services Pvt Ltd

#### Development Engineer - search

September 1999 - February 2001 (1 year 6 months)
Chennai Area, India

Projects:
* Unified Instant Messenger (UIM):
Developed a Unified Instant Messaging system that allows cross messenger
(Yahoo, AOL, MSN) chatting. This project was an extension of an open source


project called Jabber. A through understanding of XML protocols and the
existing Jabber protocols were essential.
* Web Crawler:
Developed an Automated Web Crawler, which periodically crawls the web and
updates the Search Engine of [http://www.appuonline.com.](http://www.appuonline.com.) It uses a “Recursive
Crawler Algorithm” by which it continuously keeps propagating through web
pages using links provided in them. Further, it checks for stale and dead links
in the existing URL database.
* Automated Web Page Ranking:
This was a pilot project aimed at replicating Google’s Page Rank Algorithm.
It used the services of the “Web Crawler” to get the pages and an algorithm
which ranks a web page based on its relevancy and its popularity. It involved
creating a mapping between all the web pages indexed, relative links from
each of these pages to every other page and computing the “Weightage” to be
given to every web page.
* Natural Language Search:
Developed a Prototype of “Natural Language Search” for [http://](http://)
[http://www.askappu.com](http://www.askappu.com) , an answering service aimed at providing information
on anything related to India. The prototype allows users to post their
question as “English sentences” rather than as “keywords”. This involved
considerable understanding of normal English Sentences and development of
a computational model, which determines “relative importance” of keywords
within a sentence.
